# ENG1419 - Microcontroller Programming
## Final Project

Lucca Pedra, Thomaz Passareli and Victor Fr√≥es

Our final project consists of an integrated system (hardware + software) for home security. It can be integrated into any part of a house, but it was thought of as being part of the main entrance in the first place.

Its main features are:

 - Cameras for Facial Recognition (implemented by software)
 - Integration with Telegram
 - RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
 - Keypad
 - Software-controlled electronic lock
 - A Database to store the residents of the house
